In this page I will show my test results and I will talk about the impact
on they will have on teamwork.

## My Test Results:
- MBTI: ESFJ
- Learning Style Test: Auditory 25%, Visual 30%, Tactile 45%
- Personality Test: Open 79%, Conscious 27%, Extroversive 96%,
                      Agreeableness 62%, Neuroticism 42%.

## Results & Impact on Teamwork:
These results inform that I am highly sociable and a role model to others.
I am strong in my tactile skills and am action-oriented. In a team, these
results support that I would be an excellent assertive communicator and would
be willing to complete assigned tasks. On the other hand, my excitability may
impact on my organisation and time management skills. I can create online
checklists to ensure I remain on task.
