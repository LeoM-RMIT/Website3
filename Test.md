Here is an over view

My test results are:
-	MBTI: ESFJ
-	Learning style test: Auditory 25%, Visual 30%, Tactile 45%
-	Personality Test: Open 79%, Conscious 27%, Extroversive 96%, Agreeableness 62%, Neuroticism 42%.

### Results and impact on Team work
These results inform that I am highly sociable and a role model to others. I am strong in my tactile skills and am action-oriented. In a team, these results support that I would be an excellent assertive communicator and would be willing to complete assigned tasks. On the other hand, my excitability may impact on my organisation and time management skills. I can create online checklists to ensure I remain on task.
