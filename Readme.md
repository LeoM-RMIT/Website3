# Project Casper

## Introduction
Project Casper has one purpose; to provide the highest level of security within
communication applications. This will be provided to governmental entities,
private corporations and non-government organisations (NGOs) through the use of
current and future communications infrastructure in-country and offshore.
Project Casper’s sole purpose is to provide end-to-end communications between
individuals, groups or team members assigned to messaging rooms. Casper is a
multi-platform application that can easily be installed on your PC, Mac,
Iphone and Android device. From messaging and sharing files to remotely
connecting to other devices, Casper’s sole purpose is to provide military
grade security to its users.

## Demand
Project Casper is here to provide a very simple demand to private corporations,
governments and NGOs with a need and focus on their own privacy. This has come
to play since major peer-to-peer messaging and communication companies are
lacking a very important level of privacy despite the fact that they promote
themselves to be secure and private. Corporations such as Google
(MacMillan D. & McMillan R. 2018) and Facebook (Wong J.C. 2018), have failed to
address the user’s privacy within their email, messaging and commercial
services. These corporations have come under great fire in the past few years
for their privacy practices.

### Data Harvesting
Data harvesting is the collection of user data by companies, government or
individuals from online sources (import.io N.A. 2019). When a user signs up
with the company, they agree to the application’s terms and conditions. In some
cases, they unknowingly give the company permission to access users’ personal
contacts, browsing history, previous and current location and other activities
conducted within the users’ personal devices
(Frankel S, Rosenberg M. & Confessore N. 2018).
This allows them to harvest not only data from the direct user, but data from
the users’ contacts and their contacts and so on. Data harvesting practices
create micro target content to influence and change users’ ideas and behaviour.
Information is used to selectively target users’ personal interests with
advertisements, political propaganda. Within company’s terms and conditions,
private or public consumers struggle to fully read and understand at what point
their data stops becoming private.

### Data Breaches
Data breaching is the exposure of secure, private and confidential information
without the authorisation of the owner to do so (Symantec Employee 2019).
This creates undesirable cost to companies and potential political
ramifications that can damage a country both locally and internationally.
In recent years, data breaches have had a spike increase (Clement J. 2019).
Content holding sensitive information has been stolen from customers and
high-profile users.

## Built for Privacy
We live in a world where privacy is paramount. Applications such as WhatsApp
(WhatsApp Legal Info 2019), Signal (Signal Terms & Private Policy) and Confide
(Privacy Policy 2019), provide a high-end level of end-to-end security
communications, however, they have one common flaw.
They fall under the same corporate standards and regulations for: (Kleinman Z. 2018)
-	Data harvesting
-	Data analysis
-	Record keeping
-	Corporate agendas
-	Internal upkeep without security vetting.
