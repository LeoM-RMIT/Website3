# P.C.

## Introduction
Project Casper has one purpose; to provide the highest level of security within
communication applications. This will be provided to governmental entities,
private corporations and non-government organisations (NGOs) through the use of
current and future communications infrastructure in-country and offshore.
Project Casper’s sole purpose is to provide end-to-end communications between
individuals, groups or team members assigned to messaging rooms. Casper is a
multi-platform application that can easily be installed on your PC, Mac,
Iphone and Android device. From messaging and sharing files to remotely
connecting to other devices, Casper’s sole purpose is to provide military
grade security to its users.

## Demand
Project Casper is here to provide a very simple demand to private corporations,
governments and NGOs with a need and focus on their own privacy. This has come
to play since major peer-to-peer messaging and communication companies are
lacking a very important level of privacy despite the fact that they promote
themselves to be secure and private. Corporations such as Google
(MacMillan D. & McMillan R. 2018) and Facebook (Wong J.C. 2018), have failed to
address the user’s privacy within their email, messaging and commercial
services. These corporations have come under great fire in the past few years
for their privacy practices.

### Data Harvesting
Data harvesting is the collection of user data by companies, government or
individuals from online sources (import.io N.A. 2019). When a user signs up
with the company, they agree to the application’s terms and conditions. In some
cases, they unknowingly give the company permission to access users’ personal
contacts, browsing history, previous and current location and other activities
conducted within the users’ personal devices
(Frankel S, Rosenberg M. & Confessore N. 2018).
This allows them to harvest not only data from the direct user, but data from
the users’ contacts and their contacts and so on. Data harvesting practices
create micro target content to influence and change users’ ideas and behaviour.
Information is used to selectively target users’ personal interests with
advertisements, political propaganda. Within company’s terms and conditions,
private or public consumers struggle to fully read and understand at what point
their data stops becoming private.

### Data Breaches
Data breaching is the exposure of secure, private and confidential information
without the authorisation of the owner to do so (Symantec Employee 2019).
This creates undesirable cost to companies and potential political
ramifications that can damage a country both locally and internationally.
In recent years, data breaches have had a spike increase (Clement J. 2019).
Content holding sensitive information has been stolen from customers and
high-profile users.

## Built for Privacy
We live in a world where privacy is paramount. Applications such as WhatsApp
(WhatsApp Legal Info 2019), Signal (Signal Terms & Private Policy) and Confide
(Privacy Policy 2019), provide a high-end level of end-to-end security
communications, however, they have one common flaw.
They fall under the same corporate standards and regulations for: (Kleinman Z. 2018)
-	Data harvesting
-	Data analysis
-	Record keeping
-	Corporate agendas
-	Internal upkeep without security vetting.

Project Casper’s main focus is to provide complete privacy for its clients by
introducing high-end level of end-to-end communications. This is presented to
the client by tailoring a messaging application for all platforms. Be Windows,
Mac, iPhone and Android, Project Casper will work in conjunction with its
clients’ team members to meet their communication needs. Outsiders will not be
able to access the clients’ metadata through direct hardware access. Project
Casper will provide recommended hardware that will undergo a security vetting
process to ensure no tampering and spying hardware or software has been placed
in any of the following:
-	Servers
-	Firewall Hardware
-	Routers
-	Switches
-	Laptops/Desktops
-	Mobile Phones
-	Tablets.

All equipment will be kept in a site of the client’s choice which means metadata
will only be accessible by the client. This will be possible through the use of
the current commercial communications infrastructure that incorporates
high-speed wireless communication and current military and commercial
satellite bearers.

Training and maintenance of the application, software and hardware will be
provided by experts from Project Casper under the clients’ supervision. This
will provide the capability to locally upkeep the whole system.
The application service will offer the following capabilities:
-	1 on 1 messaging
-	Group messaging up to 20 members
-	Meeting Room (Video Conference and VoIP calls)
-	Media Sharing (Documents, Image, Video and Files)

In addition, end-to-end privacy will be through Advance Encryption Standard
(AES-256), (Cisco Systems, Inc), providing military grade encryption throughout
all the clients’ activities.

## Skill Requirements
The following will be a list of skills, hardware and software requirements to
make Project Casper a reality.

### Software, Hardware & Certifications
For the contribution and developing of this application, Project Casper will
require a team which will overlook every single aspect that contributes to the
project’s cyber security and delivery:
-	Open Source projects such as Signals current Open source project (Signal 2019)
-	Encryption (Bernstein D. J. Lange T. & Schwabe P 2016)
-	Router
-	Switches
-	Servers
-	Laptops/Desktops
-	Mobile Phones
-	Tablets
-	Communication Cabinets
-	Network engineers
-	Application and Software Developers
-	Cyber Security Specialists.

## Outcome
Project Casper understands that creating an application or software doesn’t
necessarily mean that a client’s data will be secure. If Project Casper was
successful, there will be a reduction in data harvesting and breaches. By
installing all equipment at a location of their choice, the client has control
over its meta data and hardware. This will solve the current problem which lays
in the privacy policies of current commercial providers.

## Impact
The importance of security within the interconnected world will be emphasised
by Project Casper as it will deliver a greater level of security to private
companies, government, and NGOs by giving them full control of the service.
On the other hand, organisations utilising the Project’s services will have the
capability to destroy and modify their data and equipment to cover any
fraudulent activities, documentation or sensitive data.
