## Job-Qualifications-Plan (JQP)
In the JQP I will talk about my ideal job, qualifications required for the
job, my current qualifications and a plan to achieve the position mentioned
in my ideal Job.

### My Ideal Job
My ideal job would be to have the freedom to develop and materialise my own
ideas. However, a position that would appeal to me would be as Specialist
Engineer for a leading explosives company within the mining industry such as
ORICA (Seek 2019). This role would require me to provide software, hardware
and process management support for their own developed platform, Blast IQ.
Blast IQ provides the customer with the ability to design their blasting
pattern and collect data in order to analyse and better understand their
blasting operations and requirements.

### Qualifications Required for the Job
The following are the qualifications and experience required for the job:
-	Experience supporting software operations on Windows
-	Computer hardware fault finding and troubleshooting
-	Experience with CISCO networks
-	Knowledge of cloud hosted software
-	Degree in IT, Engineering and/or Communications.

### My qualifications
-	Certificate III and IV in Telecommunications.

### My plan
My current plan is to improve myself in the IT industry within the application
and software development environment as well as security. In completing my
Bachelor of IT, I am hoping to become more competitive for positions such as
the one above.
