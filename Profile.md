## My interest in IT
My interest in IT is mainly focused on the development, security and privacy
of the applications and software.

### When did it start?
My interest in IT started at a very young age. My mother purchased a brand-new
computer for me and this was intended to be used for my school work. At first,
the computer worked well. Alongside my school work, I also began playing
computer games such as Need for Speed, Contra and Super Mario Bros.

### What sparked it?
After being introduced to computer games, I began playing on other devices such
as my Game Boy and Super Nintendo. This sparked my interest in computers.
I was intrigued by how miniature people and their cars could fit in such tiny
screens.
