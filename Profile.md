## My interest in IT
My interest in IT is mainly focused on the development, security and privacy
of the applications and software.

### When did it start?
My interest in IT started at a very young age. My mother purchased a brand-new
computer for me and this was intended to be used for my school work. At first,
the computer worked well. Alongside my school work, I also began playing
computer games such as Need for Speed, Contra and Super Mario Bros.

### What sparked it?
After being introduced to computer games, I began playing on other devices such
as my Game Boy and Super Nintendo. This sparked my interest in computers.
I was intrigued by how miniature people and their cars could fit in such tiny
screens.

## My IT Experience
My experience within the IT industry has only been through networking. I am
part of a small company that have a main focus on communication. Iâ€™ve had the
chance to experience some of what network engineers do on a day-to-day basis.
I have learned from them and started to use the network equipment.

### Why RMIT
The reason why I chose RMIT was due to its reputation not only within Australia
but also internationally. In addition, RMIT offered the course that I wanted to
do online and so choosing RMIT was an easy decision for me to make.

### Learning Expectations
During my IT journey, I expect to learn about writing code, application and
software security. I would like to have a better understanding on the different
coding methods and levels of security the creation of software or applications
require.
